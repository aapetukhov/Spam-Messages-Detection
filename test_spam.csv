i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora your corpora are biased in this respect though newsgroups have a strong social taboo on posting html but in many people s personal inboxes it is quite abundant getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than i though my own saved mail doesn t reflect what i receive since i save and throw away selectively much more so than in the past multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss win

clayton vernon i have some concerns regarding vernon being able to transfer even if he is temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him according to enron policy an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or better this is to prevent problem employees being moved from one organization to the another this sounds like a work ethic issue to me and the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he is temporarily successful but if kevin presto knows the situation and he still wants vernon in the end i will push for an exception as this satisfies our obligation to be forthright please keep me informed of clayton s progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem employee thanks sheila

looking for property in spain looking for property in spain don t waste your time that is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites why because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold you could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been sold how frustrating the property market is moving very fast here in spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites what you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements just think of how much time and effort that would save you property finders spain can do
ofcourse i also upload some songs

i like this part sounds like httpd on the client url once the client component is installed a server can order a program to run on the client any cgi script java servlet asp component etc could be run on the client this is like breaking the web server into two parts originally web servers just understood http and sent pages then the field started demanding more from the web and the servers got loaded down with cgi and modperl and active pages and stuff so now the web server can choose to go back to simple serving and where the application is appropriate let the client do the other razzamatazz this is superior to javascript in one important detail the program doesn t have to reload when a new page is loaded as javascript functions do and because xdegrees uses web compatible technology users

ultimately there was a big disagreement about how to sell the product sales guys wanted to sell the thing for a gazillion dollars to megaclients but we thought it would make more sense to get more people using it so we could get more feedback from many different places the bottom line was that the route we wound up going megaclients for megabucks had a megalong sales cycle the sales force staffed up and tried to sell the earliest releases of the software even succeeding in a few significant cases but couldn t get enough to cover their own expenses much less the actual development of the product now where have i seen that before oh yeah its happening to me right now

houston research opportunity anjam vince here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for anjam actually entails it seems to me that anjam s interest in getting an expat package is mostly about money based on the uk hr s read of anjam they think he will jump i have a telephone conference with anjam at 11 00 my stance will be 110 is firm we will help with the transition via a one time settlement flat rental issues 500 lbs of air shipping for moving furniture maybe one trip back to uk a year but no more his concerns of having a place in london should he want to return i will say that vince would be far better at finding a good spot for you than any hr type so that part of the package promise is not particularly important any guidelines for me to follow

trimmed cc list daniel quinlan said 1635465 these messages could end up being falsely or incorrectly reported to razor dcc pyzor etc certain rbls too i don t think the results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way shape or form when running over a public corpus i ll note that in the readme 1635465 these messages could also be submitted more than once to projects like spamassassin that rely on filtering results submission for ga tuning and development the second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a nilsimsa signature or similar to the mass check file the results format used by spamassassin and giving the message files unique names md1635465 or sha 1635465 of each file ok maybe rewriting the message ids will help here that should allow us to pick them out i ll do

summer internship hi vince i am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my internship at enron for the summer of 2000 while the date of my request is later than i would have wished the reason is that i had originally planned to go back to turkey this summer and get my mandatory military duty done however i now realize i can put it off to a further date that left me wondering if you believe there is a project that i can get involved in this summer and be useful if that were the case i would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the summer with the research group i discussed this with dr ronn and he is very supportive of this idea i apologize again for bringing up this issue late and look forward to hearing from you

done robert elz said i suspect that as part of chris set of changes he cleaned up the use of the variable that was named l in ftoccommit in ftoc tcl its name got changed from l to lineno but there s one reference of l left that causes tracebacks if you attempt to use link with the current cvs version of exmh i guess that most of us don t use link very often i noticed it last week but only got time to look and see why today if someone with the ability to commit to the cvs repository would apply the following patch to lib ftoc tcl that would be nice it works and is trivial and you could perhaps just apply it by making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and applying it there s only one instance of l in the file that should be changed to lineno kre ftoc tcl prev wed aug 16
